# Continue using Advanced Playwright Features

Now that we have a good bit of examples we've written let's go ahead and remove the default examples playwright offers us.

* detailedExample.spec.ts
* example.spec.ts
* /tests-examples/demo-todo-app.spec.ts (directory and file)

I'll also go ahead and create 1 additional example file 

* demo.spec.ts
* /lib/demoFile.ts

These files will be used to show how we can import functions from other scripts within our codebase so we can keep our code as clean as possible.
